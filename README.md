An R package for managing and analyzing data from grazing studies.

## Overview

The `grazeR` package is designed to facilitate the management and analysis of data from grazing studies. We have developed this package to streamline the data management and analysis of our own grazing studies, but we hope that it will be useful to others as well. The package is designed to be flexible and can be used to analyze data from a variety of grazing studies. The package is currently under development and we welcome any feedback or suggestions.

## Installation

Please install the `grazeR` package from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("amantaya/grazeR")
```

Once we have a stable version of the package, we will submit it to CRAN.
